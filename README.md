 "WTF-webquiz"

Below is a well documented explanation of the implemented features and necessary instructions for running the app:

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
My WEBQUIZ Application project was structured and organised in such a way that all components, styles and assets were clear. Separate files were also created for HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT. 

 HTML STRUCTURE:
The HTML had a div with the wrapper "CONTAINER" with a class name, which wrapped up all the Question and Answer Buttons for easy styling. It also contains the "TIMER",  a "NEXT BUTTON", as well as the Tiltle of my work which is JAVASCRIPT AND FRONT-END QUIZ

 CSS STYLING:
This application makes use of CSS to ensure a clean, clear and beautiful interface and aesthetics. I used a font family to make the appearance apealing, and i also played around with the color "GREEN" which is not only soothing to the eyes but also gives the project a beautiful overview.


Javascript brought life and functionality to the project! Javascript functions were implemented to handle events like Questions (10 in number), submitting answers, calculating scores and timer, which tells how much time you have left on the Quiz.

The project Maintains a consistent coding style throughout the codebase.

Guidelines for Running the app: Below are the guidelines that follows the Quiz:

The Time on the Quiz is 5minutes, and it runs all through the 10 questions.

Once you finish yout Quiz, and your time is yet to run out, you have the grace to go through your work once more for correction.

Once you select your answer, a color difference makes you know if you are right or wrong.

You'll get points on the basis of your correct answer.
